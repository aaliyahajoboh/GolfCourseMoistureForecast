# Predictive Modeling of Soil Moisture Levels at Rush Golf Club, Dublin

## Summary:

This project aims to predict soil moisture levels at Rush Golf Club, Dublin, using time series analysis based on historical weather data from May 1st to May 31st, 2018. Soil moisture levels play a crucial role in golf course management, impacting playing conditions and overall golfing experience. Inefficient manual methods for weather forecasting prompted the need for accurate predictive models to guide maintenance schedules and optimize playing conditions.

## Objectives:

* Apply statistical and machine learning models to predict soil moisture levels.
* Evaluate model performance using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
* Provide actionable recommendations for golf course management based on model insights.

## Models Used:

1. ARIMA Model: Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average model for time series forecasting.
2. Linear Regression (LR): Predictive modeling technique capturing linear relationships between predictors and soil moisture.
3. Support Vector Regression (SVR): Kernel-based regression method applied with three kernels (Radial, Poly, Linear) to capture nonlinear patterns.
4. Random Forest (RF): Ensemble learning technique for regression tasks, capturing complex interactions between predictors.

## Dataset and Context:

Rush Golf Club, located by Fingal Bay Beach in Ireland, faces challenges in managing soil moisture levels to optimize golfing conditions. Historical weather data serves as the basis for predicting soil moisture dynamics. Manual forecasting methods were time-consuming and sometimes inaccurate, prompting the need for advanced predictive models.

## Conclusion:

By leveraging advanced statistical and machine learning techniques, this project provides valuable insights into soil moisture dynamics at Rush Golf Club. The developed models offer actionable recommendations for golf course management, enabling informed decision-making to enhance the overall golfing experience.
